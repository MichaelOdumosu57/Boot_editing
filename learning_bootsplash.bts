cp -i B.png /boot/grub
sudo update-grub

/etc/default
sudo vim grub
added:
  GRUB_DEFAULT=0
  GRUB_DEFAULT=1
sudo update-grub


so what happened was the bootloader change the option start from the first to the second so you can change it back, but the image was changed
I wish I had the original

I also removed the img i had from /boot/grub and see if I can get the original back
